This folder contains the solutions to the assignment of the awesome course CS231N given from Stanford.

You're free to use them in any way you want, but bear in mind that copying these (or any other) solutions for the Stanford 
course is considered cheating. If you're a Stanford student though, you won't need to do that in any case. For all the others,
happy (deep) learning!
